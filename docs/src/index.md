# Epidemics.jl

This is some minimal documentation for [Epidemics.jl](https://github.com/pratikunterwegs/Epidemics.jl).
**Note** that this is a personal project, and comes with no current or future support.
This documentation section is intended as a learning experience (for me) in writing Julia package documentation.

_Epidemics.jl_ is a Julia package that aims to mirror the [R package {epidemics}](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics), and to provide a robust way to model epidemic and disease outbreak scenarios.
_Epidemics.jl_ is a work in progress since it lags the development of _epidemics_.

**Note** _Epidemics.jl_ is a personal project where I aim to learn more about the Julia language; it comes with no guarantees of current or future support or maintenance.

_Epidemics.jl_ currently has basic implementations of three models, roughly tracking the R package {epidemics}.

1. `epidemic_default()`: the default model, which is an SEIRV compartmental ODE model allowing for a vaccination regime that confers full immunity with a single dose, as well as (optionally) multiple overlapping interventions to reduce social contacts;

2. `epidemic_vacamole()`: the Vacamole model developed by RIVM for the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a work in progress, but will eventually allow for two-dose leaky vaccination, as well as multiple overlapping interventions;

3. `epidemic_stochastic()`: A simple stochastic compartmental SIR model.

_Epidemics.jl_ is likely to include the Ebola model, as well as features such as time-dependence and rate interventions, from {epidemics} at some point.
